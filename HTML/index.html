	<p>This is a repository for learning and experimenting with various markup languages, such as HTML, XML, Markdown, LaTeX, and more.</p>
	<h2 id="what-are-markup-languages-">What are markup languages?</h2>
	<p>Markup languages are systems of symbols or tags that are used to annotate or format text documents. They allow the text to be processed by different applications or devices, such as web browsers, word processors, printers, etc. Markup languages can also add semantic meaning or structure to the text, such as headings, lists, tables, links, images, etc.</p>
	<p>Some examples of markup languages are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>HTML</strong>  (HyperText Markup Language): The standard language for creating web pages and web applications. It defines the structure and content of a web document using elements and attributes.</li>
		<li><strong>XML</strong>  (eXtensible Markup Language): A general-purpose language for storing and exchanging structured data. It uses tags and attributes to define elements and their relationships.</li>
		<li><strong>Markdown</strong>  (Markdown): A lightweight language for formatting plain text using simple syntax. It is widely used for writing documentation, blog posts, README files, and more. It can be converted to HTML or other formats using various tools.</li>
		<li><strong>LaTeX</strong>  (Lay-tech): A document preparation system for producing high-quality typesetting. It is especially suitable for writing scientific and mathematical documents. It uses commands and environments to define the structure and style of a document.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="why-learn-markup-languages-">Why learn markup languages?</h2>
	<p>Markup languages are useful for many reasons, such as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>They allow you to create and edit documents in a simple and human-readable way, without requiring complex software or graphical interfaces.</li>
		<li>They enable you to separate the content and presentation of a document, making it easier to maintain, reuse, and adapt to different platforms or purposes.</li>
		<li>They facilitate the communication and exchange of information between different applications, systems, or users, by providing a common and standardized format.</li>
		<li>They enhance the accessibility and usability of a document, by providing semantic and structural information that can be interpreted by various devices or agents, such as screen readers, search engines, etc.</li>
	</ul>
